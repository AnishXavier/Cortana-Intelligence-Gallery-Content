# R for SAS Users

*MRS for SAS Users* is designed to help R users learn to process, query, transform and summarize big data using MRS's `RevoScaleR` package. This course takes a use-case-based approach to walk through the knowledge discovery and data mining process using MRS. To test your readiness for the course, work out the exercises in the *R for SAS Users* course.

After completing this course, participants will be able to use R in order to:
1.  Read and process flat files (CSV) using MRS
2.  Clean and prepare data for analysis
3.  Create new features
4.  Visualize, explore, and summarize data
5.  Build analytical models on large datasets using MRS.

While we occasionally draw certain parallels between SAS and R, this course does not teach a user to do a line-by-line (or chunk-by-chunk) conversion of SAS code to R code.  Instead, by covering a thorough use-case, we attempt to show how to use R and what best practices to follow.  At the end of the course, users should have a solid understanding of how to use R to process and analyze data, and compare and contrast R and SAS in how they deal with data.  But there is no doubt that migration legacy code from SAS to R is a challenging task.
